# Healthcare Analytics(Interactive dashboard creation using Excel/PowerBI/Tableau) and SQL

## Project Objective
- To analyze healthcare data covering patients, doctors, visits, treatments, diagnoses, and lab results.
- To identify treatment effectiveness, patient trends, and high-risk groups for better decision-making.
- To build interactive dashboards that highlight KPIs such as treatment outcomes, visit trends, costs, and doctor performance.
- To provide insights that support improving patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.

- Dashboard Interaction Tableau.

## Process
- Data Collection & Preparation
Gathered data from multiple sources: Visits, Patients, Doctors, Treatments, and Lab Results.
Cleaned and standardized fields (dates, diagnosis names, treatment categories, patient demographics).
- Data Modeling
Established relationships between Patients, Visits, Treatments, and Doctors.
Created a star schema for analysis with fact tables (Visits, Treatments) and dimension tables (Patient, Doctor, Diagnosis).
- KPI & Dashboard Development
Designed metrics for treatment success rate, average treatment cost, top doctors, and patient distribution.
Built dashboards with trends by gender, state, diagnosis, and chronic conditions.
- Analysis
Used Excel pivot tables and charts to identify trends.
Derived actionable insights for hospital performance and patient outcomes.

## Insights
- Treatment Effectiveness: Success vs failure rates highlight which treatment types perform better.
- High-Risk Patients: Patients with chronic conditions and frequent visits were identified as requiring more attention.
- Doctor Performance: Top-performing doctors were ranked based on patient outcomes and treatment success.
- Cost Analysis: Average treatment cost per outcome gave insights into cost-effectiveness.

## Final Conclusion
This healthcare analytics project shows how Excel dashboards turn hospital data into actionable insights. It enables better decisions for administrators, improves patient care by identifying high-risk individuals, optimizes resources through doctor and cost tracking, and provides a scalable framework for tools like Power BI or Tableau.
